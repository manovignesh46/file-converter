# Vercel Deployment Debug

The micromatch recursion error during "Collecting build traces" suggests that there might be:

1. **Circular symbolic links** in the project
2. **Deeply nested file structures** that cause stack overflow
3. **Problematic glob patterns** in dependencies

## Current Status
- ✅ Local build works perfectly with `outputFileTracing: false`
- ❌ Vercel build fails during trace collection phase
- The error occurs in Next.js micromatch pattern matching

## Applied Fixes

### Simplified Configuration
- Disabled outputFileTracing in next.config.js
- Minimized .vercelignore patterns
- Removed complex webpack configurations
- Simplified vercel.json

### Next Steps to Try

1. **Check for symlinks**:
   ```bash
   find . -type l
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use standalone build**:
   - Set `output: 'standalone'` in next.config.js
   - This creates a self-contained build that doesn't need trace collection

3. **Remove barrel exports** if they create circular references

The issue is likely a known Next.js/Vercel limitation with certain project structures.
