# File Cleanup Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented automatic cleanup of processed files when users click "Process More Images" to prevent disk space accumulation and maintain system cleanliness.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/cleanup/route.ts`
- **GET `/api/cleanup`**: Lists all currently processed files with metadata (name, size, created, modified dates)
- **DELETE `/api/cleanup`**: Deletes all processed files from the `PROCESSED_FILES_DIR`
- **Optional Parameter**: `?olderThan=hours` to only delete files older than specified hours
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing directories and file deletion errors
- **Security**: Only operates on the configured processed files directory

### 2. UI Integration: Modified `app/page.tsx`
- Updated `clearResults()` function to call cleanup API before clearing UI state
- Added `isCleaningUp` state to show loading feedback during cleanup
- Integrated cleanup call with the "Process More Images" functionality

### 3. User Feedback: Enhanced `components/ResultsView.tsx`
- Added `isCleaningUp` prop to show loading state
- Updated "Process More Images" button to show "Cleaning up..." during cleanup
- Added spinning animation to the refresh icon during cleanup
- Disabled button during cleanup to prevent multiple simultaneous cleanups

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated `README.md` to document the automatic cleanup feature
- Added new API endpoints to the API documentation
- Enhanced `.env` file with descriptive comments

## Technical Details

### File Storage
- All processed files are stored in the directory specified by `PROCESSED_FILES_DIR` environment variable
- Default location: `./public/processed`
- Files are automatically deleted when users start a new session

### API Features
- **Listing Files**: GET endpoint provides detailed metadata about stored files
- **Selective Cleanup**: Optional time-based filtering for cleanup operations
- **Error Tolerance**: Continues operation even if individual file deletions fail
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of cleanup operations

### User Experience
- **Seamless Integration**: Cleanup happens automatically when clicking "Process More Images"
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and animations during cleanup
- **Non-blocking**: UI cleanup proceeds even if file cleanup fails
- **Performance**: Fast cleanup operations don't significantly impact user flow

## Benefits

1. **Disk Space Management**: Prevents accumulation of processed files over time
2. **Privacy**: Ensures user files don't persist on the server after sessions
3. **Performance**: Maintains clean file system for optimal performance
4. **User Experience**: Seamless automatic cleanup without user intervention
5. **Monitoring**: API endpoints allow for system monitoring and maintenance

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Cleanup API successfully lists and deletes files
- ✅ UI integration shows proper loading states
- ✅ Error handling works when directory doesn't exist
- ✅ Time-based filtering works correctly
- ✅ System continues to function normally after cleanup
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities (directory traversal protection)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scheduled Cleanup**: Could add periodic cleanup via cron jobs or background tasks
2. **File Age Policies**: Could implement different retention policies for different file types
3. **Usage Analytics**: Could track cleanup metrics for system monitoring
4. **Batch Size Limits**: Could add limits for very large cleanup operations

The implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution for automatic file cleanup while maintaining excellent user experience and system performance.
