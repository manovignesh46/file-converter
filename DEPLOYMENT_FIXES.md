# Vercel Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded during Build Trace Collection
**Root Cause**: Dynamic server usage in `/api/download-all` route using `request.nextUrl.searchParams`

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Fixed Dynamic Server Usage**:
   - Changed `/api/download-all` from GET to POST method
   - Replaced `request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('files')` with `request.json()` to receive files in request body
   - Updated frontend components (`ProgressModal.tsx`, `ResultsView.tsx`) to use POST requests with fetch API and blob handling

2. **Build Optimizations** (`.vercelignore`):
   ```
   node_modules
   .next
   .git
   dist
   build
   *.log
   .env.local
   .env.*.local
   coverage
   .nyc_output
   test
   tests
   __tests__
   *.test.*
   *.spec.*
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db
   ```

3. **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "framework": "nextjs",
     "functions": {
       "app/api/process/route.ts": { "maxDuration": 60 },
       "app/api/download-all/route.ts": { "maxDuration": 30 }
     },
     "env": {
       "SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION": "true"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Next.js Optimizations** (`next.config.js`):
   - Added webpack bundle splitting
   - Memory optimization with NODE_OPTIONS
   - Package import optimization
   - Path alias setup for cleaner imports

5. **Package.json Build Scripts**:
   - Added `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'` to build commands
   - Added `vercel-build` script for deployment

6. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Created `.env` with production settings
   - Added `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true` for Vercel builds

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

The application now builds successfully both locally and should deploy properly to Vercel:
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ No dynamic server usage during static generation
- ✅ Build trace collection completes successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript/ESLint errors resolved
- ✅ Optimized bundle sizes and memory usage

## Deployment Ready

All blocking issues have been resolved. The platform is now ready for Vercel deployment with:
- Full image processing functionality
- Proper download mechanisms (individual + ZIP)
- Optimized build process
- Production-ready configuration
